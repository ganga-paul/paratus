# Gene Loss Detection Pipeline

## Introduction
This pipeline is designed to identify orthologous genes and detect gene loss in a given set of genomes, starting from soft-masked FASTA files. It consists of three modular parts, each handling a distinct stage of the workflow:

### 1. Prepare Genomes
- Build repeat libraries.
- Soft-mask the genome.

### 2. Make LASTZ Chains
- Align masked genomes to the human reference genome (**hg38**).
- Generate alignment chains.

### 3. TOGA
- Use the alignment chains and human annotation to identify orthologous genes.
- Classify the gene status.

## Pipeline Breakdown

### Step 0: Genome Download and Cleaning
- Download raw genome assemblies.
- Clean and preprocess genomes for downstream analysis.

---

### Part 1: Prepare Genomes
**Step 1:** `BuildDatabase` and `RepeatModeler`  
**Step 2:** `RepeatClassifier`  
**Step 3:** `RepeatMasker`  

---

### Part 2: Make LASTZ Chains
**Step 4:** `Make_lastz_chains`  
- Align masked genomes to the human reference genome (**hg38**).  
- Generate alignment chains.

---

### Part 3: TOGA
**Step 5:** `TOGA`  
- Use the alignment chains and human annotation to identify orthologous genes.  
- Classify gene status.

## Step 0: Genome Download and Cleaning (Detailed)
ðŸ”„ **Manually Downloading and Scoping Multiple Genomes for Unwanted Chromosomes**  
- Genomes are downloaded from the **S3 path** provided by Paratus using the `aws s3 cp` command.  
- Downloaded genomes are arranged in a **predetermined directory structure** (explained in detail in Step 1).  
- Unwanted chromosomes are filtered out during this step.  
- Genomes are **unzipped** before the next step begins.
